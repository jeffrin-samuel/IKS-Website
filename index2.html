    <h1><u>ARYABHATTA</u></h1>
    <p> Aryabhata, primarily celebrated for his contributions to mathematics and astronomy, also influenced the field of astrology indirectly.<br> While his seminal work, the Aryabhatiya, focused on astronomy and mathematics, it laid the foundation for many astrological calculations used in India. Aryabhata's precise understanding of planetary positions, eclipses and the Earth's rotation enabled the development of accurate calendars and horoscopes, essential tools in Vedic astrology.

       <br> His advancements in calculating the positions of celestial bodies and their movements allowed astrologers to make more accurate predictions about planetary influences. However, it is important to note that Aryabhata himself did not explicitly engage in astrology; his focus was scientific observation and mathematical precision. His work provided the framework for subsequent scholars to blend astronomy and astrology in their practices.</p>
