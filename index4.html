    <h1><u>JANTAR MANTAR</u></h1>
    <p>The Jantar Mantar, a collection of five astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the 18th century, is a remarkable testament to India's rich astronomical heritage. Located in cities like Jaipur, Delhi, Ujjain, Mathura, and Varanasi, the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is the largest and most well-preserved. These structures consist of massive, precise instruments crafted from stone and marble, designed to measure time, track celestial bodies, predict eclipses, and study the orbits of planets. The Jaipur observatory, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, houses the *Samrat Yantra*, the world's largest sundial. Combining science, architecture, and art, the Jantar Mantar exemplifies India's advanced understanding of astronomy and the integration of scientific principles into cultural practices.</p>
