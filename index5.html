    <h1><u>PLANETARIUMS</u></h1>
    <p>Planetariums in India serve as vital centers for astronomy education and public engagement with space science. The Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai, established in 1977, stands as one of the country's pioneering institutions, followed by notable facilities like the Birla Planetariums in Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. These institutions feature state-of-the-art digital projection systems that create immersive experiences of the night sky and cosmic phenomena. The M.P. Birla Planetarium in Kolkata, opened in 1963, holds the distinction of being India's largest planetarium and hosts regular shows in multiple languages to cater to its diverse audience. Modern Indian planetariums offer a range of educational programs, including special shows for school children, astronomy workshops, and public lectures. They also play a crucial role during celestial events like eclipses and meteor showers by organizing public viewing sessions and providing scientific explanations. The New Delhi Planetarium, housed within the National Science Centre, has been instrumental in fostering scientific temper among young Indians through its interactive exhibits and regular sky observation programs.

       <br><b>Currently, there are around 40-50 major planetariums present in India.</b>
