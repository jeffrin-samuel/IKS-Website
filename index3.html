    <h1><u>MOON</u></h1>
    <p>Ancient Indian astronomy, known as Jyotisha, placed significant emphasis on lunar observations and calculations. The Moon (Chandra) was particularly important in the Indian astronomical tradition, with detailed observations of its movements leading to the development of the Nakshatras system - a division of the ecliptic into 27 or 28 lunar mansions. Indian astronomers like Aryabhata accurately calculated the Moon's orbital period, diameter, and distance from Earth in their astronomical treatises (Siddhantas). The concept of Tithi, based on lunar phases, became fundamental to the Indian calendar system and religious observances. Ancient texts like the Vedanga Jyotisha provided sophisticated methods for predicting lunar eclipses, with astronomers understanding the Moon's nodes (Rahu and Ketu) and their role in eclipses. The Surya Siddhanta, a major astronomical text, contained detailed calculations of lunar movements and its influence on tides. These lunar observations were not just astronomical but deeply integrated into cultural and religious practices, with festivals, ceremonies, and agricultural activities timed according to lunar phases and positions among the Nakshatras.</p>
