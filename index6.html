    <h1><u>SUN</u></h1>
    <p> Ancient Indian astronomy, or Vedanga Jyotisha, accorded supreme importance to the Sun (Surya), viewing it as both a celestial body and a divine entity. The foundational text Surya Siddhanta, attributed to divine revelation from the Sun god himself, provided remarkably accurate calculations of solar movement, equinoxes, and solstices. Indian astronomers developed sophisticated instruments like the Shanku (gnomon) and Kapala Yantra to track the Sun's apparent motion and measure time, latitude, and directions. They accurately calculated the Earth's axial tilt, the length of the solar year, and even theorized about sunspots centuries before Western astronomers. The concept of Ayanamsa, which measures the precession of equinoxes, was well understood, and solar observations were crucial for determining the Sankranti points that mark the Sun's entry into different zodiacal constellations. Beyond astronomical calculations, solar observation played a vital role in temple architecture, with many ancient temples designed to align with specific solar events and create remarkable illumination effects during solstices and equinoxes. The knowledge of solar cycles also helped in developing the solar calendar (Saura Maana) used in various parts of India, particularly in determining agricultural seasons and festival dates.</p>
