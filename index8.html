    <h1><u>APPLICATIONS OF INDIAN ASTRONOMY</u></h1>
    <p> Ancient Indian astronomy, known as Vedanga Jyotisha, had profound practical applications in daily life and ritual activities. Astronomers like Aryabhata and Varahamihira developed sophisticated methods to track celestial movements, which were crucial for determining auspicious times for religious ceremonies, agricultural activities, and maritime navigation. Their calculations helped create detailed calendars that synchronized solar and lunar cycles, essential for timing seasonal festivals and determining the Hindu panchangam (almanac). Indian astronomers also engineered remarkable instruments like the Shanku (gnomon) and Gola Yantra (spherical sundial) to measure time and celestial positions. Their astronomical knowledge was vital for urban planning, with many temples and cities aligned according to cardinal directions based on celestial observations. Additionally, their understanding of astronomical phenomena aided in predicting monsoons and weather patterns, which was crucial for agricultural planning in ancient India.</p>
