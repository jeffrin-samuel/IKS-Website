    <h1><u>INDIAN CALENDAR SYSTEM</u></h1>
    <p> The Indian calendar system, known as Panchanga, is a complex and intricate timekeeping method that combines both lunar and solar elements. It divides the year into 12 months based on both the movement of the sun through the zodiac (solar calendar) and the phases of the moon (lunar calendar), with each month starting at different points in the Gregorian calendar. The system incorporates five key elements: tithi (lunar day), vara (weekday), nakshatra (lunar mansion), yoga (auspicious period), and karana (half lunar day). Different regions of India follow various versions of this calendar system - the solar calendar predominates in regions like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, while the lunar calendar is more prevalent in North India. The calendar is not just a method of tracking time but deeply influences Hindu religious observances, festivals, and auspicious occasions. To reconcile the difference between solar and lunar years, the system periodically adds an intercalary month called Adhik Maas. This traditional calendar continues to be used alongside the Gregorian calendar in modern India, particularly for determining religious festivals and ceremonies.</p>
